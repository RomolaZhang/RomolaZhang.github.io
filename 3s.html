        The 3S is a game that wants to show how a student manages to handle the balance between Study, Social, and Sleep, the three main parts of college life. It takes the form of a 2D platformer, with a student as the main character whose movement can be controlled by the player. The study, social, and sleep parts of the studentâ€™s life are represented by different activities on different platforms. The student can jump between those platforms. The results of experiencing the three activities are inter-related. Each activity has an advantage that triggers the student to do it while spending unequal time on the three leads to bad results. The objective for the player is to help the student maintain a balanced life through a semester.
