	<div class="about">
        Poseidon is the god of the sea in ancient Greek myth. The Sound of Poseidon brings sound and water movement together. It is a set of interactive 3D musical fountains that visualize sound and music by changing the color, movement, and oscillation of several particle systems (as water drops).
        There are six different types of fountains in total, of which different combinations have various visual effects. The audience can give a sound or music through microphone, and see how it affects the fountains.
