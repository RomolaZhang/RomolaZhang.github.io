		Females studying and working in computer science and related fields form a large underrepresented group who face social structural issues from biased stereotypes on womenâ€™s capability in academia and workplace all the way to frequent sexual harassment. I participated in two hackathons before and on both of them I noticed how girls are assumed to do only the design work in a team. Through this poster I would like to convey the message that girls in STEM deserve equal treatment in their learning & working environment and they are actively promoting it.
