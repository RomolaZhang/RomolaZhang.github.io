        Inspired by one scene in Ratatouille, taste aims at visualizing the taste of food using colors and movements of particles. All effects are realized by physical simulations using p5.js. They consist of collisions, flow fields, flocking systems, oscillations, etc. The tastes of four foods are visualized in this project: strawberry, cola, sushi, and cotton candy.There is also a red bouncing ball representing the taste bud.

        Through this project I would like to offer an immersive journey for the user to discover tastes of food in a creative visualized way. It's a game where the user can control the direction of the taste bud, and let it crash into particle-packing images of food. The particles have different colors, shapes, and movements that represent the taste. BGMs are added to match the particular feeling of a food.
